### Thank you for visiting my website!

I'm a PhD sociologist from the University of Chicago who loves big ideas and big dreams. \
My biggest passion is to understand society by using new technologies and methods. \
I believe in the power of social research to inform big decisions that improve people's lives. \
That's why I strive to be in the intersection of social sciences research, statistical analysis, technology, data science, and mapping. 
I am driven by helping people visualize complex relationships in data. \
I care about presenting new, interesting, and exciting information, and challenging assumptions to allow organizations to improve their work. \
Here you can find some of my works, such as abstracts to papers and dissertation, dissertation maps and historic Chicago maps.
